The goal was to identify patterns related to movie ratings, genres and popularity.

🔍 Key questions
- Which genres receive the highest average ratings?
- Is there a relationship between popularity and rating?
- How do ratings differ across time?

🛠 Tools & technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

📈 What I did
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Data visualization
- Interpretation of results

🧠 Key takeaways
- Some genres consistently score higher ratings
