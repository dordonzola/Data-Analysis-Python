Mushroom Clustering Analysis

📊 Description

This project focuses on clustering analysis of a mushroom dataset.
The goal was to identify natural groupings in the data and explore whether mushrooms can be grouped based on their features.

🔍 Key questions

-Can mushrooms be grouped into meaningful clusters?
-Which features contribute most to cluster separation?
-How well do unsupervised learning methods perform on this dataset?

🛠 Tools & technologies

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

📈 What I did

- Data preprocessing and encoding categorical variables
- Feature scaling
- Clustering using unsupervised learning algorithms
- Visualization of clusters

🧠 Key takeaways

- Clustering revealed clear structure in the dataset
- Feature selection and preprocessing had a strong impact on results
- Unsupervised learning can uncover hidden patterns without labels

🚀 Next steps
